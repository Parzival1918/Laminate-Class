# Laminate-Class
A MATLAB class to work with composite laminate materials.

Create a composite lamina of fibres and matrix with the `CompositeLamina` class. Once you have some laminae, you can add them together into a laminate with the `compositeLaminate` class.

You can plot composite Young Modulus and other composite material properties depending on the angle the stress is applied.
